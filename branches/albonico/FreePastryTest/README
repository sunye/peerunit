1 - You need to install Ant and Maven:

http://ant.apache.org/
http://maven.apache.org/

cd ../PeerUnit
mvn install
cd -

3 - Check if all dependencies are correctly installed. You may need to install FreePastry manually.

cd ../PeerUnitTest
mvn verify

4 - Compile and generate a jar with all dependencies:

cd ../PeerUnitTest
mvn assembly:assembly

5 - Run the test:

ant


6 - The test should run correctly, even if the configuration (peerunit.properties) is not changed.
