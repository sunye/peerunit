# Here we put in numbers that will be turned into probabilities under
# the null hypothesis. In this case we put in a multiple of the counts,
# so the observed counts should show up as suspiciously good, at least
# for the log-likelihood chi-squared. Rpt rate is not really relevant with
# unequal probabilities and there is no real reason to suspect a trend
