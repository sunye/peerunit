      <br>
Peerunit architecture has two main components, the tester and the
coordinator. The role of
the tester is to execute test case actions and to control the
volatility of a single peer. The role of the coordinator is to dispatch
the actions of a test case&nbsp; through the testers and to maintain a
list of unavailable peers. <br>
The UML diagram presented in the figure illustrates the
deployment of the architecture: one coordinator controls several
testers
and each tester runs on a different logical node (the same as the peer
it controls).<br>

      <br>
The tester provides two interfaces, for action execution and volatility
control:
      <ul>
        <li>execute(): executes a given action</li>
        <li>leave(), fail(), join(): makes a set of peers leave the
system, abnormally quit and join the system.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
The coordinator provides three different interfaces, for action
execution, volatility and test case variables:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>register(), ok(), fail(), error(): action registration
(performed before all tests) and response for action execution, called
by testers once the execution of an action is finished.</li>
        <li>set(), get(): accessors for test case variables.</li>
        <li>leave(), fail(), join(): makes a set of peers leave the
system, abnormally quit and join the system.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
