# Look to see if Teapot is better overall, assuming tea brand
# and amount act according to logistic model. So score 1 for teapot
# better and 0 for infuser better, and enforce marginal total for
# tea brand and amount. First column is 1 for teapot win, 0 for
# infuser win. Next column is 1 for Twinings 0 for PG Tips. Next
# column is 0 for flat 1 for heaped. Actual score was 16. We want
# probability of getting 16 or more where probability of winning
# is 50%, given that the marginals are correct. So set left column
# to identically 1.

# The model under the null hypothesis is that the odds of the teapot
# being better/not better value are exp(a.x) where a is a coefficient
# vector of weights and x is the choice of tea quantity and type,
# expressed as +/-1. Given an observation value y as +/-1 then the
# odds of the observation are exp(y * a.x). So the odds of the
# entire experiment are exp(SUM_i y_i * a.x_i) =
# exp(a . SUM_i y_i * x_i). So this depends on the marginals only
# through their totals. Even though we don't know the vector a we know
# that any assignment of better/worse that wins the same number of
# times under tea quantity 1 and the same number of times with tea type
# 1 has the same probability, under the null hypothesis that we have
# constant 0 - no bias from teapot.
