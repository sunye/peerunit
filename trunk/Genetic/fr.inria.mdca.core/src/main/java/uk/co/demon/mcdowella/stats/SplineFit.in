# Test/sample input for SplineFit. This is intended to draw a smoothed
# line through observations distributed amongst points, by fitting a
# spline curve to the value at each point. It also produces the 
# derivative of the spline fitted, and bounds for both value and
# derivative. Fitting a spline, given weights, amounts to taking a
# linear function of the observations. As the amount of data increases,
# this spline should converge to a value that reflects what we would
# get if we fitted the spline to the underlying true value at each
# point. This is a linear function of the underlying true value and
# similarly what we actually draw is a linear function of the 
# observations. If the data are binomially distributed at each point we
# can put bounds on the variance of our linear function, regardless
# of how well the spline fits the underlying true values. This amounts
# to maximising SUM_i BiPi(1-Pi) subject to SUM_i AiPi = x.

# Input format is variance of observation divided by Pi(1-Pi)
# (e.g. number of trials for a binomial distribution), then x value,
# then value of observation (e.g. number of successes for a binomial
# distribution).

# Output has one line per input, reflecting input columns, then
# fitted spline value and bounds, then fitted spline derivative and
# bounds

# Test data has p = 0.4 between 0 and 1, then increases to p = 0.6
# between 1 and 2, and is constant at that between 2 and 3
